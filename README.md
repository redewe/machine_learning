#### Notes for testers
- Please open Final Project.pdf before reading the poi_id.py file

- This is the list of packages in my environment. Please tell me which to upgrade/downgrade in order to sync with your environment.
  - **python                    2.7.14              h8c3f1cb_23**
  - **scikit-learn              0.19.1           py27he00e316_0**

- I've ran the tester.py file on my computer and you can see the output in CAPTURE.png file. Please take note. So I need to know what the difference in environment is to reproduce the error you're seeing.
